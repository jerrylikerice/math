the reason you keep all the change is that you acknowledge that people are good at doing ineffecient things but if you can learn from the past it's possible you can do it more efficient.
And in this repo you want to solve the problem that you find hard to understand something sometimes. And you assume you don't understand because you do not know the speaker's intention. people say something can have different meaning under different context, and figuring out the context is the hardest part.

det derterminator, tr trace, rank 59, dim 55, null space N p60,

echelon form--which are easier to solve and figure out the rank
column rank, row rank--the maximal number of independent row vectors
rank of matrix--the number of nonzero rows in its row echelon form. 
eigenvalues, eigenvectors--Ac=lemma c
singular--if AB=BA=I if B exists non-singular otherwise non-singular. is used when consider inverse related isues
determinant--used to check a square matrix is invertibleï¼Œ A is invertible equals A is n*n and |A|!=0  
  minor,cofactor,adjoint--used for calculation
  
elementary transform--->elementary matrix/properties link determinants and elementary matrix(27)-->determinant properties-->inverse

elementary transform-->eigen vector and eigen value
