first order condition--first order differentiation=stationary point of f necessary condition for minimum
first derivative test
second derivaive test
second order conditions for local extremes
taylor expansion when neither first order or second order condition can not help make judgement, first order and second order are both zero p 11
multivariable second order condition-related to definity of matrix p19
existence of global maximum-optimal  value theroem-closed/bounded
special situation: corner solution, saddle point, quasi-concave function-p23
envolop therom--one choice variable and one parameter. without solve the parameter can solve the maximal p32 
optimization with equity constraints lagrange thereom basically they want to incorporate the equation constaint into the objective function by adding one more variable, by this means, the new lagrangian function happens satisfy the optimization condition for the oginal function p37
the leading minor is to determine the value of sosc when there are other parameters? p45
lagrange with inequity, watch out for lemta


dynamic optimization
