set 
  empty set
  subset
  complement, equal, intersection, union, difference,disjoint
  cartesian product? 用来表示空间，是直线，还是平面，还是实数集
function-domain,range,
  onto, 1-1 f^{-1} one-to-one reflection
  level curve?  the curve constructed by x,y where have f(x,y)=c
sequence
  limit point--convergent sequence
  euclidean distance, norm/length of vector
  triangular inequality
  ball about x_0
  p14 set close包不包括边界，closed: /ball about--open? 不包括所有的边界
  bounded 自变量有边界, compact 有边界有
  contiguity,continuous
  intermediate value theorem
differentiation
  increase,decreasing, strictly increasing, strictly decreasing
  higher order derivatives, exists and continuous
  partial derivative
  derivative or gradient?--》 use matrix to represent derivate
  p22 derivates/ tangent line?--> link level change with derivates
  directional derivatives?--> parameterized the line going through x in the direction a
  higher order partial derivatives, hessian matrix--> generalize gradient, because it is sysmmetric  so it will have many nice properties. 
  tylor expansion-->used for approximation? may related to matrix function form in the future, it's related to quatratic form 
  jacobian matrix  p27, what's the usage
homogeneous functions
  homogeneous of degree k
  euler's theorem?  why?p26  by p28, and regard t as another additional variable
  implicit function theorem?-->what does it try to address, basically it addresses when y is properly defined. the key point is that the y should have a unique value near any points
  
  above seems to address how x increase influence y, when they form a implicit function??
  whether continuous, how y changes with x p33
  then why F'!=0 means y is continuous? seems it related to for the point we need to know how y changes in regarding to x, in the x^2+y^2=25 case, at x=5, y is not differenetiable because it can be near zero either positive or negtive
  implicit function thereom for the general case: generalize the conclusion to n unknown variable case.  In this case, matrix J will be useful in terms of notation. and use matrix theory to solve the function
  ---prove: tylor expansion
  \frac{\delta_F}{\delta_y}=0 means for that point, a small change in x, y does not change, then there is no guarantee there would be y correspond to x near x_0, example in p32
  
  p43 solve for equations case: 1. general implicit function therom, how to solve linear equations
  
  concavity,
    closed interval/open interval, convex set
    covex/concave functions
    first order characterization of concave(convex) functions  the tangent plane and the fuction cue
    second-order characterization of concave functions---the sign of second order differentiation and the property of convex or concave,strictly convex and second order differentiation
    
    quasi-concavity?
    weaker constraint than concavity
    is preserved under monotone transformation
    how to judge
